# My Basic MJML/Vue Email Template

Built using [MJML](https://mjml.io/documentation/) and Vue, to learn the basics of how MJML templating works.
This is just a basic email template (something you'd perhaps see when signing up
for a service), based off Tracey Holinka [repo example](https://github.com/TraceyHolinka/vuejs-email-renderer)

## How to use

If you would like to try this out:
- clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to run off my mock json data to build the dist folder, and then open the .html file in the created dist folder (this is the compiled template)
- if you would like to experiment with the code/data, run `npm run watch` so it recompiles the .html whenver you make changes (you will need to reload the page to show the changes)
